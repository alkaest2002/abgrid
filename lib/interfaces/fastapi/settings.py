    """Application settings configuration using Pydantic BaseSettings.

    This class manages application configuration by loading settings from
    environment variables and .env files. It provides type validation,
    default values, and caching for optimal performance.

    The settings are automatically loaded from:
    1. Environment variables (highest priority)
    2. .env file in the project root
    3. Default values defined in the class

    Attributes:
        auth_secret: Secret key used for authentication token generation and validation.
                    This is a required field that must be provided via AUTH_SECRET
                    environment variable.
        max_concurrent_requests_for_group: Maximum number of concurrent requests allowed
                                         for /api/group endpoint. Defaults to 15.
        max_concurrent_requests_for_report: Maximum number of concurrent requests allowed
                                          for /api/report endpoint. Defaults to 5.

    Environment Variables:
        AUTH_SECRET: Required secret key for authentication
        MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_FOR_GROUP: Optional concurrent request limit for group endpoint (default: 15)
        MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_FOR_REPORT: Optional concurrent request limit for report endpoints (default: 5)

    Notes:
        Settings are cached using @lru_cache() for performance. The same instance
        is returned on subsequent calls to load().

        This method creates and returns a Settings instance, loading configuration

            The @lru_cache() decorator ensures this method returns the same instance
